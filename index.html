                1. You choose one of the three options: Grass, Water, or Fire.
                2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options as well.
                3. The outcomes are as follows:
                   - Grass defeats Water.
                   - Water defeats Fire.
                   - Fire defeats Grass.
                   - If both you and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
                4. Keep track of the results:
                   - If you win, you earn a point.
                   - If the computer wins, it earns a point.
                   - In the case of a tie, no points are awarded.
                5. Repeat the process for a predetermined number of rounds.
                6. At the end of the rounds, the player (you or the computer) with the most points is the overall winner.
